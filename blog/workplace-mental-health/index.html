            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Work is the leading source of stress for American adults, according to the <a href='https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/'>APA's annual Stress in America survey</a>. About 83% of workers report work-related stress, and 25% say their job is the number-one stressor in their lives. Burnout — now recognized by the WHO as an occupational phenomenon — affects an estimated 67% of workers at some point. Yet most people treat workplace mental health as a personal problem to manage privately, ignoring both their rights and the structural factors that contribute to the issue.</p><h2 id="recognizing-burnout-vs-regular-stress">Recognizing Burnout vs Regular Stress</h2><p>Stress is acute and resolves when the stressor does. Burnout is chronic and doesn't resolve with a vacation. The WHO defines burnout through three dimensions: emotional exhaustion (feeling depleted and unable to give more), depersonalization (cynicism, detachment from work and colleagues), and reduced professional efficacy (the sense that nothing you do matters or makes a difference).</p><p>Burnout isn't laziness. It's the predictable outcome of sustained demand without adequate recovery. If you're dreading work, feeling emotionally numb at the office, unable to produce at your previous level despite effort, and carrying work stress into every other area of life, that's burnout — and it requires structural change, not just better coping.</p><h2 id="the-boundaries-that-matter">The Boundaries That Matter</h2><p><strong>Time boundaries:</strong> Defining when work starts and stops. Not checking email after 7 PM. Not working weekends unless genuinely exceptional. These boundaries feel risky in hustle culture, but chronic overwork produces diminishing returns — your productivity after 50 hours/week drops sharply, and error rates increase.</p><p><strong>Communication boundaries:</strong> Not responding to Slack within 30 seconds. Batch-processing email rather than reacting to each one. Using status indicators honestly. Training colleagues that non-urgent requests don't get immediate responses.</p><p><strong>Emotional boundaries:</strong> Not absorbing your manager's stress. Not carrying responsibility for problems you didn't create and can't control. Recognizing the difference between caring about your work and letting your self-worth depend on it.</p><p>Maintaining good <a href='https://insomnia.md'>sleep</a> and physical health provides the foundation for these boundaries — you can't hold a line when you're exhausted and depleted.</p><h2 id="your-legal-rights">Your Legal Rights</h2><p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects employees with mental health conditions from discrimination and requires reasonable accommodations. Conditions that qualify include <a href='https://depression.md'>depression</a>, <a href='https://anxiety.md'>anxiety disorders</a>, <a href='https://bipolar.md'>bipolar disorder</a>, <a href='https://ptsd.md'>PTSD</a>, and <a href='https://ocd.md'>OCD</a>, among others.</p><p>Reasonable accommodations may include: flexible scheduling for therapy appointments, modified break schedules, quiet workspace, temporary reduced workload during treatment, permission to work from home, and time off for treatment. You do need to disclose your condition to HR (not your manager, necessarily) to receive accommodations, but employers cannot discriminate based on the disclosure.</p><p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for serious health conditions, including mental health conditions. You don't need to be hospitalized to qualify — ongoing treatment for a chronic condition meets the threshold.</p><h2 id="what-employers-should-be-doing">What Employers Should Be Doing</h2><p>Evidence-based workplace mental health programs include: Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) with adequate session counts (many cap at 3-6, which is insufficient), manager training in recognizing distress and responding supportively, workload management that prevents chronic overwork, psychological safety (ability to speak up without punishment), and anti-stigma initiatives that go beyond poster campaigns.</p><p>The business case is clear: depression alone costs employers an estimated $44 billion annually in lost productivity. Every $1 invested in mental health treatment returns $4 in improved health and productivity, per WHO estimates.</p><h2 id="when-work-is-the-problem">When Work Is the Problem</h2><p>Sometimes the issue isn't your coping skills — it's a toxic workplace. Chronic micromanagement, bullying, discrimination, impossible demands, and leadership that punishes vulnerability are organizational problems, not personal ones. If your mental health deteriorated specifically in response to this job, and the workplace is unwilling or unable to change, leaving may be the most effective intervention.</p><p>Distinguishing between "I need to build better boundaries" and "This environment is genuinely harmful" matters. A good therapist can help you make that distinction without defaulting to either "just try harder" or "just quit."</p><h2 id="daily-practices">Daily Practices</h2><p>Micro-recovery throughout the day — a 5-minute walk between meetings, a brief breathing exercise before a presentation, eating lunch away from your desk — prevents the cumulative stress buildup that leads to burnout. Regular physical activity, adequate <a href='https://calories.md'>nutrition</a>, and social connection outside of work provide the recovery that makes demanding work sustainable rather than destructive.</p>
